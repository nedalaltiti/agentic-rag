## Introduction

These Rules serve to maximize the utilization of data in creating promising development opportunities that necessitate data processing for purposes other than those initially specified at the time of data collection. To maximize the benefits derived from data produced, collected, or retained by entities, contributing to economic growth, these Rules have been established. They provide a framework to enable responsible data sharing by entities to serve public interest and foster research, development, and innovation. This necessitates the establishment of controls and procedures governing data-sharing requests for the aforementioned purposes within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. These Rules complement the Data Sharing Policy issued by the Saudi Data & AI Authority (SDAIA) by providing further clarity on data sharing between government entities concerning public interest objectives and the responsible advancement of research, development, and innovation. Furthermore, they provide clarity on data sharing between government and private entities for the purposes of achieving public interest and fostering research, development, and innovation.
