## Guidelines for Binding Common Rules (BCR) For Personal Data Transfer

### Introduction

Based on the Personal Data Protection Law, issued by Royal Decree No. (M/19) dated 9/2/1443 AH (the "Law") and amended by Royal Decree No. (M/148) dated 5/9/1444 AH, and its contents on the permissibility of transferring Personal Data outside the Kingdom. The Regulation on the Transfer of Personal Data Outside the Kingdom ("Transfer Regulation") sets out the provisions to be followed upon transfer, including the Rules applied in cases where Controllers are exempted from the requirements to comply with the level of protection and the minimum level of transfer of Personal Data stipulated in sub-paragraphs (b) and (c) of Paragraph (2) of Article (29) of the Law and provisions of the Regulation on the Transfer of Personal Data Outside the Kingdom.

### Purpose

The purpose of these rules is to ensure that a level of protection for personal data is applied that is not less than the level of protection prescribed by the Law and its Regulations. This is achieved by specifying obligations of the parties involved in the transfer when personal data is transferred or disclosed to a country or international organization that does not have an adequate level of protection for personal data. This document provides comprehensive instructions for a range of entities operating within and outside the Kingdom regarding the preparation of Binding Common Rules. Binding Common Rules are considered one of the appropriate safeguards that data controllers may use, in addition to processors acting on behalf of and based on the instructions of the data controller. They are also used alongside standard contractual clauses and certifications from an entity licensed by the competent authority, in accordance with the provisions governing the transfer of personal data outside the Kingdom.
