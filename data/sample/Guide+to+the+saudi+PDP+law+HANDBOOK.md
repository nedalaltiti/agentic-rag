## Executive Summary

### What is data protection?

Data protection is a set of principles, practices and measures aimed at safeguarding individuals’ personal data and ensuring compliance with data protection laws and regulations. A well-designed data protection compliance program is fundamental to enable you to be compliant with the principles and requirements of the PDPL.

While data protection is not explicitly mentioned in the Kingdom’s Vision 2030, it is closely interlinked with the Vision’s goals of digital transformation, digital economy, transparency, innovation, and building a data-driven economy. As such, data protection is fundamental to achieving these objectives.

This guide covers three sections that will introduce you to the various data protection requirements of the PDPL. This guide will be your on-the-job reference in your data protection compliance journey. Each of the key requirements of the PDPL is explained through examples, including some best practice requirements. While the examples are contextualized for a certain sector, please note that you must comply with the PDPL, regardless of the sector in which you operate.

As digital technologies become more widespread, the need for data protection becomes crucial to ensure the privacy, security and trust of individuals and businesses regarding such technologies.

In the Kingdom specifically, the processing of personal data is regulated by the Saudi Data and AI Authority (“SDAIA”).
In this guide, “processing” of personal data means any kind of use of personal data.

### Section B: Starting your data protection compliance journey

---

## A. Understanding the PDPL and the Implementing Regulations

Before starting your data protection compliance program, you must have a detailed understanding of the PDPL’s key principles, legal requirements and obligations. This also includes understanding the legal bases for processing personal data, the rights of individuals and your obligations regarding data transfers outside the Kingdom.

---

## B. Understanding the Personal Data that you hold

By understanding what personal data is¹ and what personal data you use, you can identify the types of personal data you process, determine a legal basis for processing and implement the appropriate safeguards for such personal data. The first step is to perform data discovery. Based on the data discovery, you will be able to prepare the Record of Processing Activities (“RoPA”), as required by the PDPL.

### 01 Performing Data Discovery

For effective data protection, it is crucial to perform data discovery within your organization to understand what personal data you use. You can start by identifying all the data you collect, store and process. This includes structured and unstructured data, both in electronic and physical formats, confidential and non-confidential data. You must assess where the personal data is stored, who has access to it and how it is used. To improve the quality of the data discovery, you should conduct interviews with relevant stakeholders² within your organization, review data flows and (where possible) use automated tools for data discovery.

¹ Personal data is any information that can directly or indirectly identify an individual.
² The relevant stakeholders are those employees of your organization who are extensively involved in the use of personal data or who understands the legal requirements to its processing. Usually these are the heads of such departments, as IT, HR, Legal, Compliance, etc.
*Please note that in the context of Art. 12, the term “privacy policy” means “privacy notice”.*

---

## 02 Determining a Legal Basis of Processing

Choosing a suitable legal basis for data processing is one of the key requirements of complying with the PDPL. Depending on the purpose of processing, you must select a suitable legal basis from those specified in the PDPL. Such legal bases include consent, legitimate interest, contract performance, legal obligation, etc.

---

## 03 Establishing the Records of Processing Activities (RoPA)

As part of your data protection compliance program, you are required to establish and maintain comprehensive records of processing activities. Once you complete your data discovery, you must document information on the purposes of processing, data categories, recipients, data transfers, retention periods and data security measures implemented. You must ensure that these records are regularly updated so that they reflect any changes in your data processing activities.

---

## 04 Developing and Publishing Privacy Notices

One of the key requirements of the PDPL is to develop and publish privacy notices so that you meet your transparency requirements. Privacy notices play a crucial role in providing transparency and promoting trust between you and individuals whose personal data you process. These notices inform individuals of what personal data will be collected, as well as how their personal data will be collected, used and protected on an ongoing basis. In essence, a privacy notice empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their personal data.

---

## C. Establishing Accountability and Governance

For a successful data protection compliance program, it is very important to establish accountability within your organization. This includes, for example, appointing a Data Protection Officer, where applicable, developing a data protection governance structure, establishing policies and procedures to demonstrate compliance with the PDPL, etc.

### 01 Assessing the Need for and Appointing a Data Protection Officer (DPO)

Where applicable, you must designate a DPO to oversee your data protection compliance program. The DPO must have the necessary expertise in data protection and must operate independently. The DPO’s responsibilities include, amongst other things, monitoring ongoing compliance with the PDPL, providing advice on matters related to data protection and acting as a point of contact for data subjects and the competent authority.

In this guide, “data subjects” means all individuals whose personal data you process.

### 02 Establishing a Data Protection Governance Structure

When setting up a robust data protection compliance program, it is essential to establish a strong governance structure. You can start by creating a framework that ensures accountability, transparency and effective decision-making regarding data protection practices within your organization. You must ensure that data protection roles, responsibilities and reporting lines are clearly defined in your internal documents. You must appoint individuals or committees responsible for overseeing compliance.

### 03 Developing Policies, Procedures and Conducting Training

You must also develop and implement comprehensive internal data protection policies and procedures. These must include clear guidelines on how personal data must be processed, stored and shared within your organization. In addition, you must also develop procedures for handling personal data breaches and other complaints that may be received. You must also conduct regular training and awareness programs to ensure your employees understand their roles and responsibilities in protecting personal data.

### 04 Implementing Processes for Individual Rights Requests

Individual rights are a fundamental aspect of the PDPL. These rights empower and grant individuals control over their personal data through a number of means, for example, the right to access, rectify, and erase their personal data. You must respond promptly and transparently to individual rights requests. With the use of such rights, individuals have the ability to manage their personal data in accordance with the PDPL.

---

## D. Conducting Impact Assessments

Where applicable, you must perform an impact assessment for certain processing activities. This is an assessment that helps identify and mitigate data protection risks associated with the processing of personal data. At the minimum, impact assessments must be carried out in cases required by the PDPL. They help you to ensure that data protection risks are minimized to an acceptable level with a documented mitigation plan.

---

## E. Privacy by Design and Default

Privacy by Design and Default, although not strictly required under the PDPL, is strongly encouraged to be embedded into all stages of your personal data processing lifecycle. It is a requirement to implement technical and organizational measures that ensure data protection in all your systems, products and services. This includes implementing appropriate security measures, limiting data collection to the minimum extent possible, limiting retention of personal data to specific timelines and obtaining consent from your data subjects, where necessary.

---

## F. Implementing Personal Data Breach Handling Procedure

You must establish procedures for detecting, reporting and managing personal data breaches. You must ensure notification of the data breach to the competent authority and affected data subjects, where required by the PDPL. Personal data breach response plans must be developed and tested regularly to ensure their effectiveness. In any case, where you experience a personal data breach, it should be thoroughly investigated to identify its causes and to prevent future breaches.

---

## G. Implementing Technical and Organizational Measures

Implementing technical and organizational measures is a proactive measure to safeguard personal data. Technical measures include cybersecurity technologies and controls that help safeguard data against personal data breaches. Organizational measures involve the implementation of policies, procedures, and training to promote data protection awareness and accountability among employees and stakeholders within your organization. By combining technical and organizational measures, you can establish a comprehensive data protection framework that mitigates risks, promotes trust and ensures ongoing compliance with the PDPL.

---

## H. Sharing Personal Data within the Kingdome

While personal data sharing within the Kingdom may seem straightforward, it still requires adherence to the PDPL’s requirements to protect personal data and individuals’ rights. You must ensure that appropriate technical and organizational measures (including legal safeguards) are in place to protect personal data during its sharing and processing.

---

## I. Transferring Personal Data outside the Kingdom

Transferring personal data outside the Kingdom involves moving personal data from the Kingdom to another jurisdiction. This process has become increasingly common, driven by international business operations and data-sharing practices. However, transferring personal data across borders requires careful consideration of data protection laws and regulations in both the exporting and importing jurisdictions. You must take measures to ensure that personal data are always protected and individuals’ rights are respected, as laws may vary significantly between jurisdictions.

---

## J. Monitoring and Auditing Compliance

Regular monitoring and auditing are essential to staying compliant with the PDPL and your organization’s policies. This includes conducting internal audits, reviewing personal data processing activities and verifying the effectiveness of data security measures. Results from monitoring and audits should be documented, and corrective actions should be taken promptly to address any identified gaps.

In essence, establishing and operationalizing a data protection compliance program is essential for you to achieve compliance with the PDPL. By following the initiatives outlined in this guide, you can establish good data protection practices, mitigate data protection risks and build a culture of data protection within your organization.

## Section 01

**Understanding the PDPL and the Implementing Regulations**

Understanding the PDPL is essential for developing a comprehensive data protection compliance program. The PDPL outlines the rights and obligations related to any operation carried out on personal data by any means. By understanding the PDPL, you can have a clear understanding of the data protection requirements in the Kingdom. The Implementing Regulations provide details on how general rules of PDPL must be implemented.

### A. PDPL Principles

Although the PDPL does not explicitly list data protection principles, such principles are embedded in the PDPL’s provisions. Understanding these principles will help you understand many of the requirements of the PDPL.

**There are seven key data protection principles:**

* **Lawfulness, fairness and transparency:** You must always process personal data in a fair, lawful and transparent manner.
* **Purpose limitation:** You must only process personal data for a specific and lawful purpose.
* **Data minimization:** You must only process the personal data that you truly require to achieve the purpose of processing.
* **Accuracy:** You must ensure that personal data is kept up to date and that necessary measures are in place for correcting and updating inaccurate data.
* **Storage limitation:** You must not keep personal data for longer than you need it.
* **Integrity and confidentiality:** You must implement adequate data security controls to protect personal data against loss, destruction or damage.
* **Accountability:** You must have appropriate measures and records in place to demonstrate your compliance with data protection laws, regulations and principles.

### B. What are the Rights of an Individual Under the PDPL?

One of the aims of the PDPL is to empower individuals and give them control over their personal data. As such, the PDPL sets out a list of the individual’s rights. Please note that not all of these rights are absolute, and some of them only apply under specific conditions.

**Individuals have the following rights under the PDPL:**

* **03 Right to be informed:** Individuals have the right to be informed about the lawful basis for the collection of their personal data, as well as of the purpose (aim) of such collection.

## Section 02

**Understanding the Personal Data that you hold**

By understanding the types of personal data your organization collects, processes and stores, you can assess the data protection risks and implement appropriate safeguards. This understanding allows you to determine the purposes for which the personal data is used, the legal basis for processing and the rights of individuals whose personal data you handle. It also enables you to establish the RoPA and respond to data subject requests effectively.

### A. Performing Data Discovery

**Fact:**
Organizations of all sizes and sectors can benefit from conducting data discovery to identify personal data they hold, understand data flows, establish the RoPA and assess data protection risks.

Conducting a data discovery exercise allows you to gain a comprehensive understanding of the personal data you collect, process and store. What’s more, through conducting a data discovery exercise, you can make more informed decisions about the personal data you process and identify potential vulnerabilities.

**Example | Performing Data Discovery**
A retail company that operates an online e-commerce platform commences its data protection compliance journey. First, it wants to understand what data it processes. It initiates data discovery by forming a multi-disciplinary team consisting of representatives from IT, legal, compliance and other business units. The team starts identifying and mapping all personal data within the company.

**The team takes the following steps:**

* **01 Data Inventory:**
  The team identifies various data sources, such as customer databases, transaction logs, website analytics and employee records. It also identifies any third-party vendors or partners who process personal data on behalf of the retail company.
* **02 Data Classification:**
  The team classifies the types of personal data collected, such as customer names, contact information, purchase history and payment details. It also identifies any sensitive data, such as health data, that requires additional protections under the PDPL.
* **03 Data Mapping:**
  The team works closely with its IT teams to trace the flow of data throughout the retail company’s systems. It identifies various touchpoints where personal data is collected, processed, and stored, both within internal databases and external systems.
* **04 Data Purpose and Legal Basis:**
  The team collaborates with legal and PDPL compliance experts to determine the purposes for which the personal data is collected and the legal basis for such processing.
* **05 Data Retention and Disposal:**
  The team identifies any personal data that is no longer necessary for the retail company. It establishes retention periods and implements a process for secure disposal of personal data.

### B. Determining a Legal Basis of Processing

**Fact:**
Consent must meet specific criteria to be considered valid under the PDPL. Consent should be freely given and not obtained through misleading methods. Individuals should have a genuine choice to provide or not provide consent.

Determining a suitable legal basis is the foundation of compliance with the PDPL. By carefully choosing the appropriate legal basis, you can demonstrate a responsible and compliant approach to data protection.

**Example | Determining a Legal Basis of Processing**
A healthcare provider that offers medical services to its patients collects and processes personal data, including sensitive data such as medical records of its patients.

**The healthcare provider takes the following steps:**

* **01 Identifying the Purpose:**
  The healthcare provider recognizes that to provide quality medical care and manage patient appointments, it needs to process personal data (including sensitive data). It identifies the purpose of processing, which is to fulfill its obligations as a healthcare provider and ensure the well-being of its patients.
* **02 Selecting the Legal Basis:**
  After analyzing the purpose of data processing, the healthcare provider determines that the appropriate legal basis is “executing an agreement in which the data subject is a party”. This is because the processing of patient personal data is necessary to fulfill its contractual obligation to patients, as it requires the personal data to provide medical services.
* **03 Informing the Patients:**
  The healthcare provider informs its patients about the processing activities and the chosen legal basis. It provides clear and transparent information about what personal data will be collected, why it is being processed and how it will be used.
* **04 Obtaining Consent for Specific Purposes:**
  While the “executing an agreement in which the data subject is a party” legal basis covers most of the necessary processing for providing medical services, the healthcare provider may still need to process personal data for specific purposes not directly related to the contract, such as sending health-related newsletters and reports. For these additional purposes, the healthcare provider seeks consent from patients.

---

Please note that if you rely on “Legitimate Interests” as the legal basis of processing, you must undertake a Legitimate Interest Assessment to ensure that it remains an appropriate legal basis for your processing. The requirements for such an assessment are specified in the Implementing Regulations. However, you cannot rely on “Legitimate Interests” as the legal basis if you process sensitive data (e.g., health data).

### C. Establishing the Records of Processing Activities (RoPA)

**Fact:**
Organizations of all sizes and industries must establish the RoPA. Regardless of the scale or nature of your processing, maintaining accurate records is a fundamental requirement under the PDPL.

The RoPA is an explicit requirement under the PDPL. It is a comprehensive inventory of the personal data processing activities conducted by you.
The RoPA also enables you to document data protection risks and appropriate security safeguards to mitigate the data protection risks.

**Example | Establishing a RoPA**
A technology company offering personalized fitness training programs to its customers has already performed its data discovery.

**The technology company takes the following steps:**

* **01 Documentation:**
  Based on the results of the data discovery, the company carefully documents each processing activity in the RoPA, including the contact details of the controller, the purpose of processing, the categories of personal data involved, the legal basis for processing, information on sharing of personal data within the Kingdom, data retention periods and any data transfers outside the Kingdom.
* **02 Updates and Maintenance:**
  The company establishes a process for periodic updates and maintenance of the RoPA. A responsible person, such as the DPO, shall regularly review and update the records, ensuring their accuracy and relevance.
* **03 Supporting Compliance and Audits:**
  The established RoPA shall be used for compliance assessments and audits. The company ensures that the records are readily accessible and available for inspection by the competent authority and auditors. This will demonstrate the company’s commitment to compliance with the PDPL.

### D. Developing and Publishing Privacy Notices

**Fact:**
A privacy notice is a living document, and it must be updated when your data privacy practices change.

Developing and publishing privacy notices is a vital practice for organizations to comply with the PDPL. These notices serve as essential communication tools, clearly articulating how personal data is collected, used, and safeguarded. By making privacy notices easily accessible (e.g., on websites and mobile applications), you can empower individuals to make informed decisions about their personal data. The PDPL sets out in detail what information needs to be included in the notices (e.g., the legal basis for collecting personal data, the purpose of collecting personal data, etc.).

**Example | Developing and Publishing Privacy Notices**
A software company based in Riyadh offers various technology products and services to its customers, including a cloud-based data storage platform. The software company has already established the RoPA. In order to meet its transparency requirements under the PDPL, it decides to create and publish privacy notices for its website and services.

**The software company takes the following steps:**

* **01 Drafting Privacy Notices:**
  The legal team of the company drafts privacy notices that provide clear and concise information about its processing activities. The privacy notices include, for example, sections on data collection, purposes of processing, legal bases, data sharing, data retention periods and individuals’ rights.
* **02 Accessibility and Language:**
  Recognizing the importance of accessibility, the company ensures that the privacy notices are easily accessible on its website. The company also provides notices in multiple languages to accommodate its diverse customer base.
* **03 Publishing Privacy Notices:**
  The company publishes privacy notices on its website, making them readily available to all visitors and customers. The company also provides direct links to privacy notices during the registration of new users.
* **04 Periodic Updates:**
  The company regularly reviews and updates the privacy notices to reflect changes in the company’s processing activities. 3

## Section 05

## Privacy by Design and Default

**Fact:**
It is more efficient and cost-effective to address data protection considerations early in the development process rather than attempting to implement data protection measures later.

Privacy by Design and Default, although not strictly required under the PDPL, is strongly encouraged to be embedded into all stages of your personal data processing lifecycle. Implementing privacy by design and default means integrating data protection considerations at every stage of your organization’s processes, products and services. It involves proactively addressing data protection risks from the outset and adopting data protection-friendly practices. This approach builds trust with users and ensures ongoing compliance with the PDPL.

▶ **Example | Implementing Privacy by Design and Default**

A large medical center that is based in the Kingdom is developing an online patient portal to provide convenient access to medical records and appointment scheduling for its patients. In addition, it aims to act as a research platform for doctors to conduct research on the illnesses that are affecting the Kingdom’s population. The medical center decides to implement privacy by design and default principles in the development of its patient portal.

**The medical center takes the following steps:**

**01 Data Access Controls:**
During the development of the patient portal, the medical center incorporates strict access controls to ensure that only authorized healthcare professionals can access patient records. This includes role-based access permissions and multi-factor authentication.

**02 Privacy-Centered User Interface:**
The medical center designs the patient portal with data protection in mind, ensuring that sensitive health data is not displayed publicly or visible to unauthorized users. The portal only reveals relevant health data to individual patients when they log in securely.

**03 Consent Management:**
In compliance with the PDPL, the medical center implements a consent management system. Patients are explicitly informed about the data processing activities and asked for their consent before any personal data is collected, shared or used.

**04 Data Anonymization:**
For research purposes, the medical center anonymizes patient data. This allows them and other doctors to perform valuable research on population health while preserving patient’s privacy.

**05 Data Encryption:**
The medical center ensures that all data, at rest and when being transmitted between the patient portal and its systems, is encrypted. This practice reduces the risk of unauthorized access during data transmission and when data is at rest. The medical center will also use pseudonymization controls where applicable.

**06 Regular Data Protection Audits:**
Throughout the development process and after the patient portal’s launch, the medical center conducts regular data protection audits to assess ongoing compliance with the PDPL’s requirements and identifies areas for improvement. These audits help them stay proactive in addressing data protection risks.

**07 Data Protection Training:**
The portal development team and medical staff undergo data protection training to understand the importance of privacy by design and default principles. They learn how to handle patient data in compliance with the PDPL.

## Transferring Personal Data outside the Kingdom

**Fact:**
Transfers outside the Kingdom are subject to additional requirements under the PDPL and Implementing Regulations.

Transferring personal data outside the Kingdom involves moving individuals’ personal data from the Kingdom to another country or jurisdiction. This process is often necessary for global business operations, partnerships or service delivery (e.g., while using cloud storage solutions). Such arrangements are subject to specified requirements of the PDPL and Implementing Regulations.

▶ **Example | Transferring Personal Data outside the Kingdom**

A multinational technology company headquartered in a foreign jurisdiction (a non-adequate jurisdiction¹) offers software solutions and IT services to clients around the world, including in the Kingdom. As part of its global operations, the company collects and processes personal data from clients, employees and partners.

**The company takes the following steps²:**

**01 International Client Engagement:**
The company secures a contract with a client based in the Kingdom to provide customized software development services. The client provides the personal data of its employees for account set-up and project management.

**02 Data Transfer Necessity:**
To efficiently deliver services to its client, the company needs to share certain personal data of Saudi residents, including employee names and contact information, with its development teams located in foreign jurisdictions. Therefore, the company makes a decision to arrange the transfer of personal data outside of the Kingdom.

Since the transfer is to a non-adequate jurisdiction, the company will need to review Art. 29 of the PDPL and the General Provisions of the implementing Regulations to ensure, amongst other things, the following:

* whether the transfer will impact national security or vital interests of the Kingdom;
* whether only the minimal amount of personal data necessary to fulfill the processing should be transferred;
* whether the rights of data subjects are taken into account;
* whether the purpose for the transfer has been established;
* whether an appropriate safeguard has been put in place, e.g., Binding Common Rules, standard contractual clauses, etc.; and
* Whether a risk assessment has been undertaken.

**03 Privacy Notices and Transparency:**
Both the company and its client update their privacy notices to inform their respective stakeholders about the cross-border data transfer, including the legal bases and safeguards in place.

**04 Data Retention:**
Once the engagement is completed, the company securely deletes any personal data transferred, as per the conditions of the data sharing agreement.

¹ Non-adequate jurisdiction means jurisdiction that is not on the list of jurisdictions that have an adequate level of protection for Personal Data outside the Kingdom. Such list shall be adopted in the Kingdom.
² Please note this is a very high-level step plan. The detailed review of the PDPL and Implementing Regulations will need to be undertaken to ensure compliance with cross-border personal data transfer requirements.
