### Second: Personal Data Collected from a Publicly Available Source

If the personal data was collected from a publicly available source, provided that such public availability was not in violation of the Law and its Implementing Regulations. The Controller shall ensure that a request for disclosure is directly related to a specific and clearly defined purpose or subject matter. Due diligence shall be exercised to protect the privacy of the data subject or any other individual. Disclosure shall be limited to the minimum personal data necessary to achieve its purpose.

Moreover, the Controller disclosing personal data related to an individual other than the data subject shall be obligated to exercise due diligence and implement adequate safeguards to protect the privacy of that other individual. Such measures shall include balancing the rights of the data subject with those of the other individual on a case-by-case basis and, where possible, anonymizing personal data that directly identifies the other individual.

### Third: Disclosure is Requested by a Public Entity to Serve a Public Interest, for Security Purposes, to Implement Another Law, or to Fulfill Judicial Requirements

If the data disclosure request is made by a public entity, and the disclosure is required to serve a public interest, for security purposes, to implement another law, or to fulfill judicial requirements. The Controller shall document the disclosure request and precisely specify the type of personal data to be disclosed.

When a public entity requests personal data disclosure to serve a public interest, it shall ensure that:

* The public interest is related to its statutory powers and duties.
* Appropriate measures are taken to mitigate any potential harm, including the implementation of necessary administrative and technical controls to ensure compliance of its personnel with the provisions of Article (41) of the Law.

If the disclosure is limited to subsequent data processing that does not lead to identifying the data subject or any other individual in particular.

The Controller shall ensure that a request for disclosure is directly related to a specific and clearly defined purpose or subject matter.

Moreover, the Controller disclosing personal data related to an individual other than the data subject shall be obligated to exercise due diligence and implement adequate safeguards to protect the privacy of that other individual.

### Sixth: Disclosure is Necessary to Achieve the Controller’s Legitimate Interests

If the disclosure is necessary to achieve the Controller's legitimate interests, without prejudice to the rights and interests of the data subject, and provided that the disclosed data is not sensitive.

The Controller shall ensure that a request for disclosure is directly related to a specific and clearly defined purpose or subject matter. Due diligence shall be exercised to protect the privacy of the data subject or any other individual. Disclosure shall be limited to the minimum personal data necessary to achieve its purpose.

D) The processing must be within the reasonable expectations of the data subject.

E.g.: detecting fraudulent activities and safeguarding the network and information security are considered legitimate interests.

Prior to processing personal data, including disclosure for a legitimate interest, the Controller must conduct and document an assessment of the proposed processing and its impact on the rights and interests of data subjects. The assessment shall specifically comprise the following:
A) The proposed processing activities, their purpose, the types of data involved, and the categories of data subjects.
B) An evaluation of the purpose to ensure its legitimacy and compliance with all applicable laws in the Kingdom.
C) A determination of whether the personal data processing is strictly necessary to achieve the Controller's legitimate purpose.
D) An assessment of whether the proposed processing presents any harm to the data subjects' interests or ability to exercise their statutory rights.
E) An assessment of whether any measures are required to mitigate potential risks or harms, in accordance with Paragraph (2) of Article 25 of the Implementing Regulations.

If the assessment demonstrates that the proposed processing would, in any way, violate any laws or regulations, infringe upon the rights and interests of data subjects, or cause harm to them or any other party, the Controller shall modify the proposed processing and conduct a new assessment, or consider relying on another legal basis.
