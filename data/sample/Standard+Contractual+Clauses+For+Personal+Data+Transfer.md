## Introduction

Based on the Personal Data Protection Law, issued by Royal Decree No. (M/19) dated 9/2/1443 AH (the "Law") and amended by Royal Decree No. (M/148) dated 5/9/1444 AH, and its contents on the permissibility of transferring Personal Data outside the Kingdom. The Regulation on the Transfer of Personal Data Outside the Kingdom ("Transfer Regulation") sets out the provisions to be followed upon transfer, including the Clauses applied in cases where Controllers are exempted from the requirements to comply with the level of protection and the minimum level of transfer of Personal Data stipulated in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (2) of Article (29) of the Law and provisions of the Regulation on the Transfer of Personal Data Outside the Kingdom.

## Purpose

The purpose of these Clauses is to ensure the application of a level of protection of Personal Data equivalent to the level of protection applied under the Law and Regulations by specifying the obligations of the parties involved in the transfer of Personal Data to a country or international organization that does not have an appropriate level of Personal Data protection. These Clauses are one of the appropriate safeguards that Controllers and Processors may use in addition to the Binding Common Rules (BCR) and accreditation certificates from a body licensed by the Competent Authority.

## Definitions

In this document, unless explicitly stated otherwise, the following terms shall have the meanings assigned to each of them below:

* **The Kingdom:** The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).
* **The Law:** The Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL) issued by Royal Decree No. (M/19) dated 9/2/1443 AH and amended by Royal Decree No. (M/148) dated 5/9/1444 AH.

## Scope

This document specifies the Standard Contractual Clauses issued by the Competent Authority in Appendix (1) of this document. These Clauses also apply to data controllers or Processors based on the instructions of the data controller and on their behalf, without prejudicing the responsibilities of the data controller to the competent authority or the data subject, as applicable, when transferring Personal Data outside the Kingdom to a country or international organization that does not have an appropriate level of Personal Data protection.

## Standard Contractual Clauses Rules

1. The Standard Contractual Clauses, as set out in Appendix (1) attached to this document, provide protection for Personal Data and an appropriate guarantee in accordance with the provisions of the Law and Regulations for the transfer or disclosure of Personal Data to entities outside the Kingdom from the Personal Data Exporter to the Personal Data Importer.
2. Standard Contractual Clauses specify Clauses that must be included in a contract or agreement between the Personal Data Exporter and the Personal Data Importer or placed in a separate contract or agreement.
3. The adoption of Standard Contractual Clauses does not prejudice the parties' obligations under the Law and Regulations when processing Personal Data.
4. If the Standard Contractual Clauses are included in a contract or agreement, no explicit or implicit term or provision therein shall conflict with them or limit the scope of their application or the protection expected from them. In addition, the contracting parties have the right to include any additional conditions related to the processing of Personal Data, provided that such additional conditions do not contradict and/or undermine any of the requirements of the Standard Contractual Clauses or the Law and Regulations.
5. If any party modifies the approved text (except the blank fields that are required to be filled in Standard Contractual Clauses), such modifications shall not be recognized by the Competent Authority and shall be deemed a violation of the provisions of the Law and Regulations.
6. Standard Contractual Clauses can involve more than two parties, so Controllers and additional Processors can join these Clauses as Personal Data Exporters or Personal Data Importers, depending on the nature of their role throughout the duration of the contract.
7. Personal data may not be transferred under the Standard Contractual Clauses if the laws and regulations of the recipient country or international organization prevent the Personal Data Importer from complying with the Standard Contractual Clauses.
8. To ensure effective enforcement of these Clauses, the Personal Data Importer submits to the jurisdiction of the Kingdom and undertakes to comply with and enforce any binding decision under applicable Kingdom Laws and Regulations.
9. The Personal Data Importer must agree to respond to the Competent Authority's requests and cooperate with its auditing procedures and approved compliance follow-up measures, including corrective measures and actions, and confirm to the Competent Authority in writing that the necessary actions have been taken.
10. After the adoption of the Standard Contractual Clauses, if the Personal Data Exporter determines that the Personal Data Importer is unable or no longer able to fulfill the obligations set forth in these Clauses, or the Personal Data Importer notifies the Personal Data Exporter if there is reason to believe that the obligations set forth in these Clauses cannot be fulfilled, the Personal Data Exporter must suspend transfers unless alternative measures or guarantees are adopted that meet the requirements set forth in the Law and Regulations.
11. The Competent Authority may, at its discretion, make any change to the Standard Contractual Clauses contained in this document, and if any change is made, the Competent Authority will issue rules regarding transitional measures, as well as rules regarding the remaining validity period of agreements under the previous Standard Contractual Clauses.

Before implementing the Standard Contractual Clauses, all parties must identify the template that applies to the relevant transfers according to the nature of their roles and delete those that do not apply:
