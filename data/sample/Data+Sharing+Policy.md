## First: Scope

1. The provisions of this Policy govern the sharing of government entity data with Data Requesters, irrespective of its form or nature. This includes, but is not limited to, paper records, emails, data stored on electronic media, audio or video recordings, maps, photographs, manuscripts, handwritten documents, or any other form of recorded data.
2. The provisions of this Policy do not apply to data-sharing processes when the Data Requester is a government entity and the request is for security purposes, to comply with judicial requirements, or in fulfillment of an international agreement to which the Kingdom is a party.
3. The provisions of this Policy do not apply when the Data Requester is a government entity and the data-sharing request is for the purpose of exercising regulatory functions or monitoring the performance of government entities in accordance with the Data Requester's systems or regulations, subject to compliance with the following:
   A. The data-sharing request shall be documented in a dedicated log by the data management office of the Data Sharing Entity.
   B. The Data Requester shall request only the minimum data required to fulfill the purpose for its collection and retention, while ensuring compliance with relevant laws and regulations or other relevant regulatory requirements.
   C. Data sharing shall be conducted automatically through the Government Service Bus or other secure automated methods. In cases where automated sharing is not possible, and data sharing is to be conducted through non-automated means, the data sharing shall be performed through a secure and reliable method designated by the competent authorities.
   D. Shared data shall be destroyed upon the fulfillment of its intended purpose, in compliance with relevant laws and regulations or other relevant regulatory requirements.

## Second: The Main Principles for Data Sharing

### First Principle: Data Sharing Culture

Each Data Source Entity shall share the data it produces in accordance with the provisions of this Policy, in order to enhance the utilization of such data and achieve integration among government entities.

### Second Principle: The Single Source of Truth (SSOT)

Government entities shall collect data as a Single Source of Truth (in the context of exercising their statutory powers), with the possibility of sharing and reusing the collected data in a manner that does not conflict with any relevant regulations. This aims to reduce data duplication, inconsistencies, and disparate data sources, ensuring data integration, recency, and quality.

### Third Principle: Legitimate Purpose

Data sharing shall be conducted for legitimate purposes that are grounded in a legal basis or justified operational need. Such data-sharing activities shall not compromise national interests, the operations of entities, individual privacy, or environmental safety. The shared data shall be used by the Data Requester solely for the purposes specified in the data-sharing request.

### Fourth Principle: Authorized Access

All Data Sharing Parties shall be authorized to access, obtain, and utilize the shared data. Such access is granted through the identification and verification of authorized personnel (when necessary, such verification is contingent upon the data's nature, classification, and sensitivity level, as outlined in the Data Classification Policy).

### Fifth Principle: Transparency

All necessary information pertaining to data-sharing requests shall be made available to all Data Sharing Parties. This includes a clear description of the requested data, its classification levels (as defined in the Data Classification Policy), collection purpose, storage methods, protection controls, and destruction mechanism.

### Sixth Principle: Collective Accountability

All Data Sharing Parties shall be held collectively accountable for data-sharing decisions, consistent with the roles and responsibilities outlined in the Data Sharing Agreement or applicable controls, as the case may be, to ensure data is processed in alignment with the specified purposes.

### Seventh Principle: Data Security

All Data Sharing Parties shall implement appropriate security controls to protect data and ensure a secure and reliable data-sharing environment as per relevant regulatory requirements and directives issued by the National Cybersecurity Authority.

### Eight Principle: Ethical Data Use

All Data Sharing Parties shall, in compliance with relevant regulatory requirements, adhere to ethical principles, to ensure responsibility, fairness, integrity, and trust in data use.

## Third: The General Rules for Data Sharing

In accordance with the data sharing protocols established in Clause (Sixth), the following general rules shall govern data sharing among entities:

1. If the Data Requester is a government entity, data sharing is conducted automatically through the Government Service Bus.
2. If automated data sharing between government entities cannot be conducted through the approved methods outlined in Paragraph (1) of this Clause or if the Data Sharing Entity has valid justification, the Data Sharing Parties shall propose a secure and appropriate alternative method to the Office for approval.
3. If neither of the methods specified in Paragraphs (1) and (2) is possible, and data sharing is to be conducted through non-automated means, the Data Sharing Parties shall conduct data sharing through a secure and reliable method designated by the competent authorities.
4. The Data Marketplace shall serve as the primary platform for inter-governmental data-sharing requests. In cases where data cannot be acquired through the Data Marketplace, government entities may submit requests to the Data Sharing Entity’s Office for the publication of the requested data on the Government Service Bus, subject to the procedures determined by the Office.
5. If the Data Requester is a non-government entity, the data-sharing request shall be submitted to the relevant Data Sharing Entity’s Office in accordance with the procedures determined by the Office.
6. Metadata shall be attached upon data sharing, with a clear specification of the classification levels of the requested data.
7. Data-sharing requests from government entities shall be subject to the Data Sharing Controls Template provided by the Office.
8. If the requested data is operational data and the Data Sharing Entity is neither the Data Source Entity nor the Authorized Entity, and the request does not include the consent of the Data Source Entity, the Data Sharing Entity shall notify the Data Requester within (5) business days of receipt of the request to obtain the consent of the Data Source Entity. The Data Source Entity shall respond to the request with approval or rejection, in whole or in part, provided that any rejection shall be accompanied by a justification, within a period not exceeding (10) business days of the consent request.
9. If the Data Source Entity does not respond within the time period specified in Paragraph (8) of this Clause, this shall be deemed a rejection of the request.

10. The Data Sharing Entity may engage in data-sharing activities without the consent of the Data Source Entity if it has been authorized to do so under Clause (Fourth).
11. The Data Sharing Parties shall comply with the provisions governing competition when engaging in data-sharing activities and shall not enter into agreements that would prejudice relevant statutory provisions.
12. Subject to Paragraph (6) of Clause (Sixth), a data-sharing agreement shall be signed by the first officer or his/her duly authorized representative of the Data Sharing Entity if the requested data is classified as secret or top secret, and shall be signed by the director of the data management office of the Data Sharing Entity when the shared data is classified as restricted.
13. If the requested data is for analytical purposes, the data shall be requested from the National Data Bank. If this is not possible, it shall be acquired from the Data Source Entity subject to the provisions of Paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this Clause.
