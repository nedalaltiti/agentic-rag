   A. Standard contractual clauses.
   B. Binding common rules.

2. The controller is exempt from the two conditions required for transferring or disclosing personal data to a party outside the Kingdom, as stipulated in paragraphs (b) and (c) of paragraph (2) of Article (29) of the Law, or either of them. However, the transfer or disclosure of personal data to a party outside the Kingdom shall still be subject to appropriate safeguards in the following cases:

   A. If the transfer or disclosure of personal data is to be made between public bodies to implement an agreement to which the Kingdom is a party or to serve its interests, the controllers must include standard provisions for the protection of personal data in the relevant agreements or memoranda of understanding.
   B. If the transfer or disclosure is non-recurring or for a limited period and involves a limited number of data subjects, the controller must comply with the standard contractual clauses. Alternatively, if the transfer or disclosure is made to a body that has received an approval certificate from an entity licensed by the competent authority and the data is not sensitive.
   C. If the transfer or disclosure of personal data is necessary to perform central operations and the controller is part of a group of multinational entities, the controller and its affiliates must comply with binding common rules or standard contractual clauses that ensure adherence to the requirements stipulated by the Law and Regulations. Alternatively, the entity to which the personal data will be transferred or disclosed must obtain a certificate of approval issued by a body licensed by the competent authority.
   D. If the transfer or disclosure is made to provide a service or benefit directly to the data subject in a manner that does not violate their expectations or conflict with their interests, and if the transfer or disclosure is to a party that has received an approval certificate from a body licensed by the competent authority, provided that the data must not be sensitive.
   E. If the transfer or disclosure of personal data is necessary for conducting scientific research and studies, it must be limited to the minimum amount of data required. The controller must either comply with standard contractual clauses or ensure that the transfer or disclosure is made to a body that has received an approval certificate from an entity licensed by the competent authority, provided that the data must not be sensitive.

3. Appropriate safeguards must ensure that controllers comply with the provisions set out in the Law and its Regulations, as well as protect the rights of personal data subjects, including the right to file a complaint with the competent authority and to seek compensation for any damage caused by violations of these rights.

4. The competent authority may review the adequacy of the appropriate safeguards specified for each exemption case outlined in paragraph (2) of this Article, and may amend them every two years or as necessary.
