=== INSTRUCTIONS ===
Answer the question above using ONLY the context provided.

Requirements:
- Place inline citation numbers [1], [2] immediately after each fact that uses that source
- You MUST cite every source you use — if you reference information from source [3], include [3] inline
- The citation numbers MUST match the source numbers in the context above (e.g., [1] refers to Source [1])
- Use markdown formatting: headers (###), bullet points, and **bold** for key terms
- Structure your answer with clear sections when appropriate
- Be thorough and well-organized
- NEVER add a separate "Citations", "References", or "Sources" section — all citations must be inline only
- Do NOT end with any closing line like "Is there anything else..." — the system will add it automatically
- Do NOT include follow-up questions or "Related Questions" at the end — the system handles this separately
